# Example Vue.js Single Page App

### [Live demo](http://crudkit.com/vue-spa/)

This is my evolving attempt to build a full single page app with the vuejs ecosystem. This uses:

* Vue for rendering
* Vue-router for routing
* Vuex for state management
* The standard `vue-cli` based webpack build system and file layout

Coming Soon:

* Authentication and JWT
* Wrapping jQuery UI components into directives
